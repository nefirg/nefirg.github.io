        <h3>Purpose</h3>

            The purpose of this website is to make known to everyone that a chamber of Commerce
            is a voluntary partnership of businesses and professionals that work together to
            build a healthy economy and improve the quality of life in their communities.
            The purpose is to inform everyone in the city/community of any developments,
            such as with the Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, and with any political changes
            that may occur in town or recent business openings. <br />
            This website will show you the importance of being a part of your community
            and how your influence builds trust and grows your business as well as
            helps your community know that you exist. You will see how much fun and informative
            it can be to get to know your fellow community members. You will benefit greatly from

            There will be a local weather information tab to check how the weather tends to
            influence our community on a regular basis, so if you're weather station is down,
            tv cuts off, a bad radio, or just lack of television, grab your laptop, grab your car
            and go to your local wifi hotspot and search us up @ www.rockdale-commerce.us.

        <p>
            I like the professional standard look that IM Fell French Canon SC
            provides the page. The default is sometimes better, the paragraphs have
            been changed to <br />
            something different though to make it a nice contrast between really
            professional and somewhat entertaining.

        <h4>
            Paragraph Font: Lato, Helvetica, sans-serif
            <!-- change this -->
        </h4>
        <p>
            This font has been changed to sans-serif because sans stands for without
            the fancy looking font that serif gives a professional newspaper webpage
            <br />
            Since this webpage is to provide a bit of a lighter mood while keeping
            its professionality, I felt like this font does just that.

            The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
            in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
            above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
            child pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
            be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
            global navigation for the site.

            Wireframes

        <p>
            Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
            major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
            locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
            be 6 sections to our page:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
                means an image) and the navigation bar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
                screen.
            </li>
            <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
            <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
            <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
            <li>
                Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
                icons.
            </li>
