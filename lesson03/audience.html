        <img id="3" src="/lesson03/img/matea.jpg" alt="Matea">
        <p>Matea's career choice is to become a professional hockey model. She is 18 years old and she's on the olympics baseball team for hockey!</p>
        <img id="4" src="/lesson03/img/Mateo_Arias.jpg" alt="Mateo">
        <p>Mateo's career choice is to become a nerd! He is amazing in that his nerdiness got him through engineering school and his love of steak got him
            a promotion in the work of arts and tesla!</p>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p>Scenario 1: These two went on a hike to national mountain park in national mountain idaho close to sugar and found 
            huge debris falling from the sky, in the shapes of meatballs! They were just hiking when they stumbled upon some 
            spaghetti sauce on the ground and out of no where meatballs came pouring from the sky!
        </p>
        <p>Scenario 2: When you can't hike a rock you have to dig through it so these two used their bare hands
            and found fossils that were related to the time during massive volcanoes. They went from place to place searching for the perfect 
            fossil and found a kitten fossil from the year 23000BC!
        </p>
        <p>Scenario 3: Mateo one day decided to climb a steep icey hill and stumbled unto 
            a big maze. At the end of the Maze Mateo said he witnessed first hand a hail storm that was 
            enclosed by savannah like trees. He said that the hail storm hurt that he had to go another way or he would have died!
        </p>
        <p>Scenario 4: Matea witnessed first hand what a fight between Zeus and Aphrodite was like. There was so much smoke and she remembered the 
            lighting show that entailed. She said, "I have never witnessed so much zappery in my life!" She then fell to the ground and enjoyed the 
            remaining 2 days of this terrible freak fight which ended in Zeus as the winner and everything calmed down.
        </p>
        <p>Scenario 5: These two found themselves stuck between a hurricane and the killer bees coming from the Chinese front.
            They reported vividly the conditions as the boat rocked higher than the highest ride on six flags and how the bees were no joke, they were
            defeating those water waves using some magical killer bee buzz. It was incredible!
